 * threshold the tool is handed the press where it was made and every move after it: a stroke begun on a chip is
 * drawn. A tool that does not take the drag (Pin) gives the camera back at that point. Over a chip, with no button held, the tool is still handed the moves (without what is under the chip), so
 * that its preview does not freeze. A press that began beside a chip is the tool's to the end.
