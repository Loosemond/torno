 * the viewport, a click on a mark goes to it, a click on a face or an edge selects it, and a click on the build on show opens the sheet of the build after it that failed. One that names nothing
 * in the window now (another layout, a part not drawn, a mark that is gone) says so in its tooltip and does
 * nothing else. `value` is the ref (`ref` is React's own word). `prose`: the ref was found in running text, where one
 * the object has no such thing as (`M3` the screw, a build not made yet) is only text.
