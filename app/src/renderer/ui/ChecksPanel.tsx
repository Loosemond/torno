/**
 * The checks the model declares in its `checks(p)`, as the kernel measured them at the last build: a row for each,
 * in the model's order, with how it stands in a word, what was measured and what was wanted (numbers in the monospace
 * face). They are the model's own, in the agent's colour: the person's dimensions are marks, and no check here
 * resolves or replaces one. Read only. A reading from sampling or approximate says so, and a pass is only what was
 * measured. Under the rows, what the agent made easier to pass or took out since it was first declared. A model with
 * no checks, or a kernel that does not read them, has no section.
