# The first screen, recent folders, the example, and the window's questions

Moved as written from the folder `CLAUDE.md` files; each heading names the folder it came from, and paths are written as they were there (see "Rules by area" in the root `CLAUDE.md`).

## The first screen (`app/src/main`)

- The folders opened lately are `recent` in torno's own config file
  (`~/.config/torno/config.json`, on macOS `~/Library/Application Support/torno/config.json`, or `TORNO_CONFIG`; `src/main/recent.ts`):
  the newest first, eight at most, beside `workspace`. Never in a workspace.
  One that is no longer a folder is shown struck and leaves the list only
  when the person removes it. A test run reads and writes no config file but
  one it names with `TORNO_CONFIG`, and Electron keeps its own profile in a folder of the run in the temporary
  folder (`testProfile.ts`).
- The example is a copy of the project in `app/resources/example` (`EXAMPLE_OBJECTS` in
  `src/main/example.ts`: one, `enclosure`, a model written after the `torno-model` skill's template, with its
  `brief.md` and, in its `.torno/`, `marks.json` and `scene.json` and nothing else of it:
  `copiedOfExample`; `kernel/tests/test_example.py` builds it and holds its marks to the build) made in the
  system's temporary folder when it is asked for, once in a run, with a marker file at its top
  (`EXAMPLE_MARKER`). It is removed at the end of `will-quit`, after the
  writes that were under way and the sessions have ended (`removeExample`),
  and one a crash left is removed at the next start (`sweepExamples`): only
  ever a real folder that marker names, of a torno that no longer runs.
  `WorkspaceInfo.example` says the open folder is it, and the window says
  `EXAMPLE_NOTE` under the workspace's name.
  The example's own folder is never opened in place and never written to (the kernel's test workspace has nothing
  to do with it). **Keeping it** (`keepExample`, channel `workspace:keepExample`; the root CLAUDE.md names it among the writes
  outside `.torno/`) copies the open copy, with whatever was made in it (not the marker, `__pycache__`, links, nor
  `.torno/session.json` and `state.md`, which are of the run), to a new folder at the path the save dialog gave
  (under test `pickSave`): planned first (256 MB, 5,000 entries, 12 deep at most), written in a hidden
  `.<name>.torno-new-<random>` beside it, the name taken by `mkdir` and the hidden folder renamed onto it as the last
  step, refused for any name that is taken in any case; the copy to keep is `ws.info.root`, which must carry the
  marker. The folder is then opened and remembered like one chosen in "Open folder"; the temporary copy stays until
  quit, as ever. The copy is
  not remembered: not as the workspace to open next, not as a recent folder.

## Agents (`app/src/main`)

- **Closing the window ends torno and every session in it, so it is asked first.** Main holds the window's
  `close` (`createWindow` in `index.ts`) and sends `window:closeAsked`; the window answers `window:closeAnswer`
  at once (`App.tsx`, from `renderer/closing.ts` `closingWhy`): `true` when nothing would be cut short, and the
  window closes; `false` while it asks the person in a dialog over the whole window (`ui/WorkspaceQuestion.tsx`: "Close torno?",
  "Keep it open" in focus), and then `true` only on "Close torno". The dialog lists what is cut short, a line each, with the
  object it is of as a link to it (`closingWhy` returns `{ objectId, what }` items): a session working or waiting for an
  answer (`busyWith`), a prompt written and not sent, a new object not made, a first prompt held, a painting of a region
  holding what is not kept (`unkept`), an import, an export being written. A window that does not answer within
  `CLOSE_ANSWER_MS` (1.5 s), or is loading or crashed, is closed without one; a quit that does not come through
  the window (`before-quit`, as `app.close()` of a test) is not held. Under test the question is answered by
  clicking it (`e2e/session.spec.ts`).

## The first screen (`app/src/renderer`)

- With no folder open the window is `ui/Welcome.tsx`. On a first run (no recent folder): a line of what torno is,
  a three-row tree of the folder of objects, an object and its model, "Open folder" with a note that an empty
  folder is fine, and, where torno runs from its repository, a quiet "Open the example". Coming back: the recent
  folders first, no tree. One footer: torno writes only into `.torno`, and the new folder of a project you make. Its head is the logo (`ui/Logo.tsx`) over the name: the vise in `--ink`, the part in `--accent`. The
  same logo is in `--muted` over an empty view or page, and plain (one colour) where a picture is missing.
- For as long as the example is the open folder, the note under the folder's name (`EXAMPLE_NOTE`) has a link-button,
  "Keep this as a folder…" (`KEEP` in `App.tsx`, through `leave`, so that it asks first as opening a folder does):
  main shows the save dialog and copies (`workspace.keepExample`); the folder it made is opened in place of the copy.
- With a folder open, the folder button of the left column is a menu
  (`ui/FolderMenu.tsx`): the recent folders, "Open folder…", "Open the
  example". A folder torno is started with (`TORNO_WORKSPACE`) is added to the
  recent ones; the workspace to open next stays the one chosen in the window. The open folder's row is marked
  with a check and the word "current" in the muted face. A folder that cannot be opened (one gone since the menu
  was read, one main refuses) leaves the workspace as it is and is said under the folder's name, a `role="alert"`
  line with `openProblem`'s text, until the next action (`goTo` in `App.tsx` returns the problem).
- **The window's own questions are dialogs over the whole window, not strips of a panel.** Closing torno and
  opening another folder while something would be cut short ask in `ui/WorkspaceQuestion.tsx`, a centred
  `alertdialog` (modal: nothing behind it takes a click or a key, Tab goes round within it, "Keep it open" /
  "Stay here" in focus, Escape presses it, even with the focus elsewhere). Its keys are heard before any other
  listener's (`keyGate`, added to the window when the module is read, before the window's own keys and the view's):
  while it stands no key reaches anything behind it, wherever the focus is, and a press on its backdrop leaves the
  focus in it. It stands over the sheet of what torno needs, which shares its layer (`data-question`). It lists a line for each thing with the
  object it is of, as a link that goes to that object (or to the page of a new one) and puts the question away
  (`closingWhy`, `leavingWhy` in `closing.ts` return those items). `ui/Confirm.tsx` stays the strip for a question
  about one panel (a scan, a mark, the session).
