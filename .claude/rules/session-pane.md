# The session pane: the terminal, the signs of a session, the pane with no session

Moved as written from the folder `CLAUDE.md` files; each heading names the folder it came from, and paths are written as they were there (see "Rules by area" in the root `CLAUDE.md`).

## Agents (`app/src/renderer`)

- The agent's terminal (`ui/SessionPane.tsx`) has its inset in the pane in the terminal's ground: the panel's,
  or the one the agent paints the edges of its screen in, when it paints one. Most of the left column and the
  bottom row decides (`ui/termGround.ts` `edgeGround`, after every write parsed); the terminal's own ground and
  the inset then take it, so that the agent's screen fills the pane (`window.__tornoTerm.ground()`; the
  stand-in's `ground r g b`).
- A session away from its pane is told where the eye is (`ui/sessionSign.ts` the rule, `ui/SessionDot.tsx` the dot,
  still, 6 px, the status line's `.status-dot`). Only `working` and `needs_input` have a sign: `working` is a
  `--muted` dot with no words; `needs_input` is `--warn`, a larger dot on the dock's toggle and the words "needs you"
  on a row, never colour alone: the state is the element's `aria-description` and its `title`, and never part of its
  accessible name, which stays the object's name (a row) or `Show session` / `Hide session` (the toggle), so that a test
  and a person's tools find a row by its name whatever its session does: the row's description is `session needs you`
  (`is working`), the hidden dock's toggle's is `Claude Code needs you`. The status line's button (`.status-needs`,
  in a `role="status"` that is always there) names the first object of the list whose session waits, with "and N
  more"; it opens that object, shows the dock (`dockOpen` and `actions.setDockOpen` are in the store, not in
  `App.tsx`) and `focusAsk` takes the focus to the open card or the terminal once the pane is of that object. The
  toggle's dot is of the open object's session and only while the dock is hidden. The switcher the list folds to
  carries the dot of any object of the list whose session works or waits (`switcherSign`: a waiting one first);
  its words name the object whose session waits (`bracket needs you`), "needs you" alone when it is the open
  object's, and its description says each (`session is working; bracket needs you`); its menu has the rows' dots.
- On the New object page the pane is of the object being made (`drafting` in `SessionPane`): no status, no End,
  New session or Resume, no view switch, no held prompt, and `DraftPane` in the body; `.session-term` stays laid out.
  A live session (any status but `exited`) of the object that was open stays as it is, with the note
  `.session-aside` above it ("This is the session of …"); an ended one counts as none.
- **The pane with no session, in the chat view** (`ui/chat/StartChat.tsx`, in `SessionPane` when `choice.view` is `chat`)
  has the box at its foot (`data-start-composer`, not `data-chat-composer`: that is the live chat's): Enter starts a
  session and sends the prompt to it (`startWith`, the prompt held in `pending` until the session exists, so that the
  trust question keeps it; a failed send puts it in the new chat's box, and a terminal view types it at the prompt,
  `fixRequest`, never sent). With a conversation on file (`resumable`) it shows the end of that conversation read-only
  under "Last conversation, 2 days ago" (`chat.lastConversation`: main reads `.torno/chat/`, the words and the turns of
  the last eight items, no tools, writes nothing; `ago.ts`), and "Continue" (resume, the default) / "New conversation"
  beside "Send". "New session" and "Resume" stay as plain buttons: they start with no prompt, and what was written
  waits unsent in the new chat's box (`holdDraft`). A terminal view keeps the old empty state. No "Attach view" or
  "Draw on view" here: a drawing is of a session.
- The session header names Claude Code, the one agent there is; under it, "Chat · Terminal" chooses the view.
  When `.torno/agent.json` could not be followed (`note` of `session:current`) the pane says why, with "Use
  Claude Code", which writes the file anew and is disabled while a session runs.
- **A build's chip says what it was made from** (#62). A context item carries `identity` (`BuildIdentity`, main's, from `builds.jsonl`'s
  record of this run); the `r12` chip's title gets `made from sources …, on a1b2c3d with changes` (`RefChip`'s `of`, `identitySaid`),
  and a build line's "Show text" has it in a line. Under "Earlier in this conversation" (`ChatEarlier`) the title says that a
  revision counts from 1 in every run and may name another build now. The status line and the card say what has changed since
  the last commit (`useGit`, `GitText`): read, never written.
