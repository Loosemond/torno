# The MCP tools: the list, their schemas and what they share; refusals; the prompts

Moved as written from the folder `CLAUDE.md` files; each heading names the folder it came from, and paths are written as they were there (see "Rules by area" in the root `CLAUDE.md`).

## Marks (`app/src/main`)

- The MCP tools (`src/main/mcp/schemas.ts` holds every input schema and
  description, and `TOOLS`; `mcp/tools.ts` registers them and holds what
  every tool shares, with `marks` and `describe`; `scene`, `look`, `show` and
  `save_view` are in `mcp/viewTools.ts`; those that place and resolve marks in
  `mcp/markTools.ts`; those that read the part in `mcp/readTools.ts`; those
  that ask about scans in `mcp/scanTools.ts`): `scene`, `look`, `marks`,
  `describe`, `highlight`, `ask`, `show`, `save_view`, `add_mark`, `resolve_mark`,
  `measure`, `section`, `check`, `diff`, `history`, `expect`, `try_fillet`, `try_params`, `features`, `scans`, `scan_clash`, `scan_deviation`.
  `expect` (`mcp/expectTools.ts`, `Expectations`, wired in `index.ts`) is the agent's note on one edit: checks on a
  part's volume, faces, edges or size, a `measure` with `expected`, or `unchanged` parts, taken against the last
  build and held in memory for the next successful build only (never a file, never a mark, never a Stop reason). It is
  settled in `buildContextFor`'s wrapper in `index.ts` and told once as the last line of the edit's answer; `scene`
  keeps the last verdict. Numbers not exact are `≈` and judged within the kernel's doubt; a ref of a part whose
  face (or edge) count changed is told as moved and not measured.
  `diff` compares two of the last two successful builds (`Builds.scenes`; the blob of the older is not kept) or any build kept in the history (#56:
  `from` and `to` take a revision, `r3`, or an id, `h41`; `ToolDeps.history` and `historyScene`, read by `ipc.ts` `historyOf` after the writes that
  just landed, 2 s at most; a revision of this run that is no longer in memory is found there too; given only the last build, the
  default is the newest kept build of other sources; what a kept build had then (`failingChecks`, `defects`, `dimensions`) is told with a
  note that it is as of then); `history` (`historyTool`) lists the kept builds newest first or gives one with the paths of its
  copies, so that the agent can read them and edit the project's files itself.
  Each part is compared by `partDiff` of `shared/diff.ts`, which the window's status line and ghosts use too,
  from what the kernel sent with each, asking it nothing: a number is `exact` only where both builds say so.
  `look` and `show` take the name of a saved view as `view`, and `save_view`
  proposes one (Views). `show` changes
  the view for now and is never saved to `scene.json`; it is refused while a
  button is held in the viewport. `marks`, `describe`, `add_mark`, `measure`,
  `section`, `check` and the three scan tools say which
  revision they answer from, and that it is stale while a newer build runs or
  has failed. `scene` counts the unresolved dimensions held to a value
  (`dimensions: {pass, fail, notMeasured}`).
  - What a client reads of a tool before it calls one is beside its description in `TOOLS`: a `title` (sentence
    case), `annotations` and, for the tools loaded upfront, `meta`. Every tool has `openWorldHint: false`; the
    ones that only read have `readOnlyHint: true` (`scene`, `look`, `marks`, `describe`, `measure`, `section`,
    `check`, `diff`, `history`, `try_fillet`, `try_params`, `features`, `scans`, `scan_clash`, `scan_deviation`: Claude Code runs the calls of those side by side;
    `look` reads, the picture it writes under `.torno/views/` being torno's own), the rest `readOnlyHint: false,
    destructiveHint: false`. `scene`, `look`, `marks`, `describe` and `measure` have
    `_meta["anthropic/alwaysLoad"]` (Claude Code's tool search defers every other MCP tool until it is searched for,
    and each upfront tool costs context in every turn and sits in the prompt cache's prefix: the list stays short).
    The server gives `instructions` at `initialize` (`SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS`: a paragraph on what the server is for,
    then a line for every tool in the words an agent would search with; under 4,096 characters, which Claude Code
    cuts at: `schemas.test.ts` holds that, every tool's line, and every description under the same length). A
    tool added to `TOOLS` has a title, annotations and a line there, or the test fails. Annotations change nothing
    of what `--allowedTools` permits.
  - Every tool is registered through `registerTools`, which refuses a key the
    tool's schema in `TOOLS` does not name (`refusedKeys`, `mcp/keys.ts`),
    naming the keys it takes: a dropped key would change what is measured. A
    new argument goes into the schema, or it is refused.
  - The schemas of a plane and of an end of a measurement refuse nothing
    (`planeInput`, `endInput`: a union that ends in `z.unknown()`): whatever
    is given reaches the handler, which answers with what one looks like
    (`NO_PLANE`, `noEnd`). Keep it so: the schema's own refusal says only
    "Invalid input".
  - `measure`, `section` and `check` answer with the kernel's reply and a
    `reading` of it in a line. Refs and marks are checked against the scene in
    main before the kernel is asked (`endsOf`: a mark stands for what it is on
    only when the last build's check confirmed it, and a dimension for
    neither of its ends), and nothing is said to be exact that the kernel
    does not say is: `≈` and `approximate` otherwise. A query that took its
    30 s is told as that; the answer of a worker still busy with one is told
    in the kernel's words (`refusal` in `mcp/readTools.ts`).
- **A refusal is not a failure.** What the person asked that cannot be done (a dimension the kernel refuses,
  one placed on an older build or between parts torno spread apart, a change of a mark that is not valid, a
  choice while a session runs) is thrown as a `Refusal` (`main/refusal.ts`). Every channel is registered through
  `handle` in `ipc.ts` (`refusable`), which resolves a `Refusal` as `{ __tornoRefused: message }`
  (`shared/refusal.ts`) so that Electron prints nothing; the preload throws it again (`unrefused`), so the window
  sees a rejection with that message. Anything else is thrown, and logged.
- The MCP prompts (`mcp/prompts.ts`, `PROMPTS`, registered by `registerPrompts` beside the tools): `review`,
  `printable` (argument `bed`, `XxYxZ` in mm, read by `parseBed`) and `explain`, each one user message. Their text
  names tools through a `toolName`, Claude Code's (`mcp__torno__<tool>`): the server is stateless and does not know
  the client. The manual lists them as `/mcp__torno__<name>` (`readme.test.ts` holds it to `PROMPTS`).
