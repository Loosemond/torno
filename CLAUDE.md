# torno

A desktop workbench for making CAD parts with an AI coding agent. `README.md`
says what it does and how to run it; the design is
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-08-torno-design.md`.

- `app/`: the Electron app (pnpm, TypeScript, electron-vite). `src/main` is the
  shell, the kernel client, the sessions, the HTTP server with the MCP tools and
  the hooks, and the marks (`src/main/marks`). `src/renderer` is the UI, the
  three.js viewport (`viewport/`) and the tools that point at it (`tools/`).
  `src/shared` holds the types both sides use; `shared/bridge.ts` is everything
  the renderer may ask of main.
- `kernel/`: the Python package `torno_kernel` (uv). It loads build123d models
  and tessellates them, in forked workers.
- `scripts/torno`: the launcher. It rebuilds the app when a source is newer
  than `app/out/.built`, which it touches only after a build that succeeded.

## Tests

Run from the repository root.

```sh
pnpm test                          # app unit tests: app/src/**/*.test.ts (vitest)
pnpm test:kernel                   # app against the real kernel and a stand-in agent: app/src/**/*.itest.ts (vitest)
(cd kernel && uv run pytest -q)    # the kernel alone (pytest)
pnpm test:e2e                      # builds the app, then drives it in a hidden window: app/e2e/*.spec.ts (Playwright)
pnpm -C app typecheck
```

One file: `pnpm -C app exec vitest run src/main/context.test.ts`,
`pnpm -C app exec vitest run --mode kernel src/main/sessions/manager.itest.ts`,
`pnpm -C app exec playwright test e2e/loop.spec.ts` (after `pnpm build`).

While iterating run the focused test; run all four suites before a commit.

## Global Constraints

- Never write inside a user workspace except under `<object>/.torno/`. Never run `uv sync` there: always `uv run --no-sync`, and only when `<workspace>/.venv` exists: without it uv would create one, so no kernel is started and builds fail saying to run `uv sync`.
- The kernel supervisor only imports. It never loads a model, builds, tessellates or answers a query. Workers never fork.
- Kernel stdout carries protocol frames only. Model output goes to a captured buffer.
- Units are millimetres, Z up. Coordinates crossing a process boundary are in the object frame unless named `local`.
- Renderer: `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`, `backgroundThrottling: false`. No per-frame state in React.
- HTTP server binds `127.0.0.1` only, on an OS-assigned port.
- Images for the agent: long edge at most 2000 px, default 1280.
- Do not copy nerv's look: no black/red/amber, no condensed uppercase labels, no corner-tick frames. Follow spec section 10 and the tokens in Task 4.
- UI text is sentence case. Every number and ref is set in the monospace face.
- Tests must not open a visible window: `show: false` when `TORNO_TEST=1`.
- Commit after every task with a message describing the change, ending with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.

("The tokens in Task 4" are `app/src/renderer/styles/tokens.css`.)

## Marks

- A mark is a pin, a pick, an arrow, a stroke, a shape or a dimension, with a
  note (`app/src/shared/marks.ts`). Ids are `M1`, `M2`, … per object, never reused,
  given by main only.
- Main is the only writer of `<object>/.torno/marks.json`
  (`src/main/marks/store.ts`): one change at a time per object, written
  atomically before it is told. The renderer and the MCP tools go through it.
- Coordinates and refs of a mark are in the object frame of the mark's layout.
  A ref is `<part>`, `<part>/F<i>`, `<part>/E<i>` or `M<n>`; to the kernel it
  is sent with the layout in front (`assembly:lid/F12`).
- After every successful build, and when a mark is added, reopened or put
  somewhere else, the marks are checked against the build
  (`src/main/marks/reanchor.ts`, one `nearest` query per layout). A mark stays
  where it was put on its part; its ref and descriptor are refreshed;
  `anchorState` says `drifted` or `orphaned`. Whatever reports a mark says so:
  the agent is told nothing it cannot rely on.
  - The one way a mark moves: its anchor records how far its part was spread
    for display (`Anchor.arranged`, zeros for a part that was not moved), and
    when a build spreads the part otherwise, everything the mark holds moves
    by the difference before it is judged. An anchor that records none (a
    mark from before) is not moved: the check records it. Main sets
    `arranged` (`asPlaced`), never the window.
  - A check writes what it judged each mark from; `MarkStore.reanchor` passes
    over a mark whose anchors are no longer those (it was put somewhere else
    meanwhile).
  - `checkedRevision` is the build a mark was last checked against. An open
    mark with any other than the last build's is unchecked (`isUnchecked`),
    and every report of it says so. Revisions count from 1 in every run, so
    the store drops what a file says of it when the file is read. A check
    that could not say of every mark is tried again after 2, 10 and 30 s
    (`retrying`), until the workspace is closed.
  - A pin whose point is on an edge is on that edge (`judgePin`): its anchor
    has `edge` and, when two faces meet there, `between`.
- Status: `draft` until a `UserPromptSubmit` hook has carried the mark to the
  agent of its own object (`src/main/context.ts`; turned `sent` only once the
  answer has left), then `resolved`. No other hook consumes drafts. A sent
  mark of the person's whose note or shape changes is a draft again
  (`sentBefore`: told as `(changed)`), and one the person makes a draft again
  after it was resolved says so until it is sent (`reopened`: told as
  `(reopened by the user)`).
- What only main says of a mark (`MAIN_ONLY_KEYS` in `shared/marks.ts`:
  `resolvedBy`, `acknowledged`, `sentBefore`, `reopened`, `checkedRevision`) is never
  taken from the window or from a tool's arguments. A mark the agent resolved
  stays in the panel's main list until the person acknowledges it.
- A dimension is a mark that holds an exact value: a distance or an angle
  between its two ends (`a`, `b`), or a radius, a diameter or a wall thickness
  at its one. Main measures it with the kernel's `measure` as it is kept
  (`src/main/marks/measure.ts`: each end goes with its ref and its point, an
  end with no ref as a bare point), and one the kernel refuses is not kept.
  `value`, `how`, `points`, `measuredRevision` and `verdict` (`MEASURED_KEYS`)
  are main's alone, like `MAIN_ONLY_KEYS`. The verdict is never stored on
  anyone's word: the sanitiser works it out (`shared/dimension.ts`: pass when
  `|value − expected| <= tolerance`, 0.05 mm or 0.1° when none is given). A
  changed `expected` or `tolerance` is news of the mark (`(changed)`); a value
  measured again is not. Its ends are judged like pins. A dimension whose ends
  moved or lost their part, or that has no value, is never given one anywhere:
  it says `not measurable` (`measuredValue`). Unresolved, it is "pinned".
  Numbers shown are written by `shared/format.ts` `number`, on both sides.
- The MCP tools (`src/main/mcp/tools.ts`, and those that place and resolve
  marks in `mcp/markTools.ts`): `scene`, `look`, `marks`, `describe`,
  `highlight`, `show`, `add_mark`, `resolve_mark`. `show` changes
  the view for now and is never saved to `scene.json`; it is refused while a
  button is held in the viewport. `marks`, `describe` and `add_mark` say which
  revision they answer from, and that it is stale while a newer build runs or
  has failed.
- `<object>/.torno/state.md` says the same as the tools, as text
  (`src/main/statefile.ts`); its first line is when it was written.
- User marks are drawn in `--user-mark`, agent marks in `--agent-mark`, and
  nothing else in the UI uses those colours. A picture for the agent draws
  every mark alike: no active mark, no selection, no hover, no gizmo. A mark
  on a part that is not drawn is not drawn either, on screen or in a picture.
- Tools and keys: `V` select, `P` pin, `A` arrow, `D` draw, `S` shape, `X`
  section, `M`
  measure (`T` there: the wall under the pointer); `G`, `R`, `T` for the gizmo
  of the active shape. A tool is a `Tool`
  (`src/renderer/tools/Tool.ts`) and gets every pointer event from the one
  subscription in `ui/ViewportPane.tsx`. Nothing of a pointer move goes
  through React or the store.

## Section

- One plane per object view (`SectionPlane` in `shared/view.ts`: `origin` and
  a unit `normal`, object frame; what is on the side the normal points to is
  not drawn). It is view state: `store.section`, saved in `scene.json`
  (`section`), reported in `ViewState`, drawn in `look` pictures unless they
  ask for another plane or none. The agent's `show` sets it for now, never in
  the saved file. It never changes geometry or marks.
- Drawing is `viewport/section.ts`: the parts' materials are clipped, and each
  closed solid (`BuiltPart.solid`) gets its cut face by stencil counting, per
  part, with an outline from the mesh. A part that is no closed solid is cut
  open. What lies in the plane is kept (`KEPT_WITHIN_MM`); a part the plane
  only touches or leaves nothing of is not drawn (`keepsNothing`). Marks,
  grid and gizmo are not cut; a mark anchored in the half taken away is drawn
  dimmed (`MarkLayer.setSection`).
- Picking sees what is drawn (`pickUnder`): on a cut face nothing is hit and
  the pointer says so.
- The Section tool (`tools/sectionTool.ts`) moves the plane only by a drag
  that starts on its handle; any other drag turns the camera. The bar is
  `ui/SectionBar.tsx`. The plane moves in the viewport during a drag and is
  kept in the store once, on release, to the millionth of a millimetre.
- Numbers shown or told of a section go through `shared/format.ts`.

## Kernel invariants

- **The supervisor only imports.** `python -m torno_kernel` imports build123d
  and ocp-tessellate so that every worker it forks has them loaded, and then
  only routes frames. It never loads a model, builds, tessellates or answers a
  query: one OCC operation in it would start OCC's thread pool, and every
  worker forked afterwards would deadlock.
- **Workers never fork.** One worker is forked per build. For each object
  folder, the last one that succeeded stays alive to answer queries about that
  object, and is replaced when the next build of that folder succeeds. At most
  four stay alive: a fifth folder retires the one least recently built or
  queried, whose queries are then `no_build`. A worker keeps what `nearest`
  worked out of each part it was asked about. A query names its folder (`dir`)
  and has 30 s, after which it is answered `timeout` and the worker left alone.
  Until that worker has answered every query that was given up on, new queries
  to it are answered `timeout` at once: it answers one at a time, and is still
  busy with those.
  A worker leaves through `os._exit`.
- **prctl.** Each worker sets `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` to SIGKILL, so it dies with
  the supervisor even when that is killed, and `PR_SET_DUMPABLE` to 0, so a
  crashing model does not wait seconds on a core dump.
- **Timeouts.** Every build has one: 600 s unless the request names another
  (the app passes `TORNO_BUILD_TIMEOUT`), a day at most; one that is not a
  positive, finite number is a `bad_request`.
  A build past it is killed and answered with `error.kind: "timeout"`. A
  worker that crashes is answered with `crash`, one that is superseded with
  `cancelled`. The supervisor never blocks on a write.
- **A worker is not trusted.** A frame from the building worker that is not a
  result (not JSON, or without its scene or error) is a `crash` of that build;
  the supervisor carries on. Frames are written with `allow_nan=False`: a scene
  that holds a NaN is an `exception` reply, never bytes that are not JSON.
- **One geometry.** A `print` layout whose parts overlap in XY is spread along
  X in the worker, before tessellation (`arrange.py`). The shape itself is
  moved, so the mesh, the bounding box and the shape kept for queries agree;
  the part carries the translation as `arranged`. The viewport never moves a
  part.
- **stdout is the protocol.** The kernel keeps the real stdout for frames and
  points fd 1 at stderr; a worker points fd 1 and 2 at a capture buffer and
  stdin at `/dev/null`. What a model prints comes back as `output`.
- The app starts the kernel with `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`, so importing a
  model writes no `__pycache__` into the workspace.

## Testing the app in a hidden window

The person is working on this desktop. No test, script or check may put a
window on it.

- Every Electron launch sets `TORNO_TEST=1`. Main then creates the window with
  `show: false` and never shows it, and exposes the test hooks.
- Never pass `--ozone-platform=headless`: Electron segfaults with it here.
- `page.screenshot()` never returns on a hidden window. Do not call it.
  `webContents.capturePage()` delivers one image per launch and hangs on the
  second call.
- Pictures of the parts come only from `window.__tornoTest.look(request)`, the
  same code the `look` tool uses; it renders to a target and does not wait for
  a frame.
- State is read through hooks, not pixels: `window.__tornoTest.state()` and
  `.camera()`, `.pickAt(fx, fy)` for what a point of the canvas is on and
  `.project(point)` for where a point of the object is drawn (both in fractions
  of the canvas, to aim `page.mouse` with), `.markScreen(id)` for where a
  mark's label is, `.timePicks(count)` for what a pick costs,
  `window.__tornoTerm.text()` for what the terminal shows, and
  `globalThis.__tornoMain` in main (`app.evaluate`) for the MCP address, the
  mark store (to leave the marks an agent would) and `marksChecks(objectId)`
  (started and finished counts: equal when no check of the marks is under way).
- `page.mouse` and `page.keyboard` work on the hidden window: marks are placed
  in tests with real pointer events through the tools.
- A test works on a temporary copy of `kernel/tests/fixtures/ws`, never on
  the fixtures themselves and never on a real workspace.
- Do not touch the clipboard.
- Never click "Open folder" unless main runs with `TORNO_TEST=1`: only then is
  the folder dialog replaced by `globalThis.__tornoMain.pickFolder` (the folder
  to answer with, or null), and `picks` counts the times it was asked.
- `TORNO_TEST=1` also skips the single-instance lock, so test launches can run
  side by side.

## Never run the real `claude` CLI from tests

Tests set `TORNO_AGENT_CMD` to the stand-in, `node app/test/fake-agent.mjs`,
which prints its arguments and posts hooks on request. The real CLI spends the
person's subscription, depends on their login and settings, and asks questions
in folders it has not seen. Checking torno against the real CLI is done by
hand, once per change that needs it.
