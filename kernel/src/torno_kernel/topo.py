"""The kernel's canonical order of a shape's faces and edges.

Index ``i`` here is index ``i`` in the tessellation's per-face and per-edge
arrays. Faces come out in the same order as build123d's ``shape.faces()``.
Edges do not match ``shape.edges()``, which drops degenerate edges such as a
sphere's pole; they are kept here so the indices stay aligned with the mesh.
